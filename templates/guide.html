                    </div>
                    <h3><strong>Election</strong></h3>
                        <p>It&#39;s important to learn about what election is! </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask the AI what is the definition of election!</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Now that you know what election is about consider whether or not being elected is Conditional (Arminianism) or Unconditional (Calvinism)</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask it about what the Arminian view is</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Ask it about the Calvinist view</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Consider asking what are the main difference between Arminian and Calvinist perspectives</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Now with the knowledge of Election try thinking about three ways we can be inspired by the Doctrine of Election</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>If you can&#39;t think of any consider asking the AI!</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    <h3><strong>Calling</strong></h3>
                        <p>Now we move onto calling. Once God&#39;s people are chosen, they must be called by God to follow him. There are two main ways to be called, the <strong>general call</strong> and the <strong>effectual call</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Consider asking the AI what the difference between the general and effectual call is</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Consider asking the definition of the General Call</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Consider asking the definition of the Effectual Call</strong><ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask the AI about Biblical Sources about the Effectual Call to see what the Bible says!</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Ask it a difficult question such as, Why does God do the General Call if he knows they won&#39;t turn to him?</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    <h3><strong>Regeneration</strong></h3>
                        <p>Regeneration is all about what God does in us after we are called by him. This is mainly through spiritual rebirth in individuals, giving them new life.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask the AI about how we know an individual has been through regeneration</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Consider asking what changes God does in us through regeneration</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Regeneration affects us in three ways, <em>mind, heart and will</em></p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Consider asking how our mind is changed through regeneration</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Consider asking how our heart is changed through regeneration</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Consider asking how our will is changed through regeneration</strong></li>
                        </ul>                   
                    <h3><strong>Conversion</strong></h3>
                        <p>Conversion plays a crucial role in one&#39;s salvation. Its role involves thinking how one thinks and believes, for the purpose of bringing us closer to God&#39;s will</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask the AI to define conversion</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Inquire about the roles of repentance and faith in conversion.</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Repentance is a key aspect of conversion. One must have a resolution to abstain from a life of sin</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask the AI for a detailed explanation of repentance</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Ask the AI to explore the three aspects of true repentance: intellectual, emotional and volitional</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Ask for biblical examples about repentance</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Faith is another cornerstone on the road towards conversion. Without it we can&#39;t turn away from a life of sin and live a life fulfilling towards the Lord.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Request a definition of faith and its importance</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Ask it, What are the three aspects of faith?</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Ask about the relationship between faith and repentance</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="box">

                    </div>
                    <h3><strong>Justification</strong></h3>
                        <p>Justification is God&#39;s process of cleaning us so that we are fully righteous; not by our own works but by Jesus&#39; sacrifice. It&#39;s relevance in the doctrine of salvation is so that we may one day restore our connection with God. This is done through the imputed nature of Christ&#39;s righteousness</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask about the definition of imputed</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Consider asking why we need justification in the first place</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Ask about why we can&#39;t be righteous out of our own works and efforts</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In the process of justification there are negative and positive aspects of justification</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask about what are some of the negative aspects of justification</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Ask about what are some of the positive aspects of justification</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are two main ways we are justified through Christ&#39;s righteousness</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask it about the difference between imputed and imparted in the context of Justification</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The end result of justification is Peace with God, Salvation from God&#39;s wrath and glorification.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Adoption</strong></h3>
                        <p>Adoption is a beautiful concept in theology that speaks to our relationship with God. It&#39;s not just about being chosen; it&#39;s about being welcomed into God&#39;s family as His children. With this new identity come both privileges and responsibilities. </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask the AI about the the difference between adoption and conversion</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Inquire about the significance being adopted by God has</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As we are adopted we are granted certain privileges such as a community and a future inheritance from our Father</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Consider what type of inheritance the Father will leave us with</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>What type of community are we adopted into?</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>What role does the holy spirit play in perfecting our relationships?</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Alongside these benefits we also bear new responsibilities such as bearing the family name/reputation of the God&#39;s name.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask what it means to bear God&#39;s family name and reputation</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Consider how being a child of God influences our choices and behaviors.</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3><strong>Union with Christ</strong></h3>
                        <p>In the next part of Soteriology we need to know the definition of the union with Christ.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask about the definition of the union with Christ.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>What does it mean to be in union with Christ?</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The idea behind the &quot;union with Christ&quot; is essential in our doctrine of salvation for it is through Christ we are able to love the Lord.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask for some biblical sources which represent this idea</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Despite the positive sides of being one with Christ, we are also told that we will suffer with him</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask about how suffering can bring us closer to the Lord</strong></li>
                        </ul>



                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <div class = "box">
                        <h2>Week 3-4</h2>
                    </div>
                    <h3><strong>Sanctification</strong></h3>
                        <p>Sanctification is about the process of becoming more Christ-like in our lives. This is achieved through God&#39;s grace which leads us to depart from the life of sin.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask the AI what is the life of sin</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Ask the AI What it means to be Christ-like</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are two main ways of viewing sanctification. Progressive and Positional</p>
                        <p>Progressive Sanctification is an ongoing process of growing in righteousness, guided by the Holy Spirit and obeying God&#39;s will.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask the AI What are some Bible Verses about progressive sanctification</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Ask the AI how obeying God&#39;s will makes us more Christ-like</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Positional Sanctification is the status we receive at the moment of regeneration, where we are declared holy and set apart by God for his purposes</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask the AI about Bible Verses which support Positional Sanctification</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Ask it how Progressive and Positional sanctification is different and where it is the same</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Sanctification&#39;s process can be understood between Imputation vs. Impartation</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask the AI how Sanctification&#39;s Imputation and Impartation differs from Justification&#39;s Imputation and Impartation</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The different views is that Imputation refers to God&#39;s righteousness being attributed to us in justification. While Impartation is the process of Christ&#39;s righteousness being bestowed upon us in sanctification. </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ask the AI how sanctification enables us to love more genuinely and selflessly</strong></li>
